# Human-Activity-Recognition-ResNets
### Description :
Human Activity Recognition by using ResNets Architecture and CV to Classify the Activity or movement and assign labels to them
This project is created with a perspective of Recognising Human Activities. The human activity recognition model was trained on Kinetics 400 Dataset.
### Installations :
 - [Install Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
 - [Install OpenCV for windows](https://docs.opencv.org/master/d5/de5/tutorial_py_setup_in_windows.html)
- Execute the following command in terminal:
` pip install numpy` 

### Directory Structure :
C:\Users\DYLAN\OneDrive\Desktop\human-activity-recognition-ResNets\model\resnet-34_kinetics.onnx

### External download :
- You need to dowwload a **`resnet-34_kinetics.onnx`** model from [**here**](https://www.dropbox.com/s/065l4vr8bptzohb/resnet-34_kinetics.onnx?dl=1) and once downloaded drop it inside the `model` directory of our project (shown in directory structure)
